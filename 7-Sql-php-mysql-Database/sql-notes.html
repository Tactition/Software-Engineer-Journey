    <h1>Sql Database</h1>
    <p>Structured Query Language</p>
    <pre>
    Sql is used for following things:

    sql creates databases
    sql creates tables in database 

    sql can insert data 
    sql can update data
    sql can retrive data 
    sql can delete data

     <p>Database has two type</p> 

     <b>Ist</b>: client Side -- localStorage, indexdb,
     <b>2nd</b>: server side -- sql mysql and mongodb

    <u>there are two things in database</u> <br>
     <b>Ist</b> : database language.---like sql for storing the data in database software eg RDBMS          
     <b>2nd</b>: database Software. --- It is a software where data acctually stores like mysql oracle ms access and microsoft sql server.

     <b>Types of Database Server</b>
     RDBMS : it is a software which stores the actual data but in terms of table . like rows and columns.
     
     Non-RDBMS : these are softwares which also stores data but not in table formate.. these databases store data in json or object(key:value) formate and with help of noSql Language


     <h4>Use of Sql</h4>
    
    1) <code>CREATE DATABASE DATABASENAME</code> :- Used to Create database in consol or terminal

    2) <code>DROP DATABASE DATABASENAME</code> :- Used to DELETE database in consol or terminal

    3) <code>CREATE TABLE table_Name(
        admision_no int(255),
        students_name varchar(255),
        roll_no int(255)
        )</code>  :- Used to make table in database through consol or terminal
        Must define the data type at last of the column name 

    3.5) <code> 
        CREATE TABLE table_Name(
        admision_no int(255) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
        students_name varchar(255),
        PRIMARY KEY(admision_no)
    </code> --: It is used to create a table with some logi(to avoid null value and increament the number automatically to avoid same column no repetation like serial no)    

    4) <code>INSERT INTO table_name(admision_no,students_name,roll_no)
          VALUES(1,"abrar",1020);
        </code>    :- Used to add data in table through consol or terminal


    5) <code>SELECT admision_no,students_name FROM table_name</code> :- to get the columns from any table

    6) <code>UPDATE databaseName
        SET students_name = "Mubii",roll_no = 1200;
    </code> :- it is used to update the data in in table all the rows will be updated with upper inserted data

    6.5) <code>UPDATE databaseName
        SET students_name = "Mubii",roll_no = 1200;
        WHERE students_name ="zahid"
    </code> :- it is used to update the specific data in row

    7) <code>SELECT * FROM databasename</code> :- to go to database tables

    8) <code>DELETE FROM databaseName WHERE TABLE row-name = table_cell_value </code> --: delete the row from table
    
    9) <code> DELETE FROM DATABASENAME </code> :- delete all the data (rows and columns) from database

    9.2) <code>
        ALTER TABLE tabname
        DROP COLUMN rollno
    </code> it is used to delete the column from the table

              ORDER BY table_cell_data Asc | DESC
    </code> :- This will sort the table data in terms of ascending(ASC) Or Decending(DESC)

    12) <code> SELECT admision_no FROM DATABASENAME 
        ORDER BY table_cell_data Asc LIMIT = 4 </code> :-- It selects the admision_no column only and displays you the 4 columns of it 

    13) <code>

     </code>

        :-- this code will copy the data of students name who has A in their grades column and will put it into the another table nameed toppers inside s_name


     realations between table 

     inner join
     left join
     right join
     full join 
     self Join

     <code>
        SELECT addmision.name,fee.t_fee FROM addmision
        INNER JOIN fee
        ON students.id = fee.id;
     </code>

     :-- it is used to join the table data or form the releation between diffrent tables in database.. 
     but to join we must have to keep any colum same(releated) and use Any of join method to form the releation

   

    group By same in Sql
     <code>
        SELECT grade FROM students
        GROUP BY grade;
     </code>
     it is used to group the repetative data of the table



     count the 
     <code>
