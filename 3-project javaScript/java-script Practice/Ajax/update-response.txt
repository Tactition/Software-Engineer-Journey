AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique used in web development to create asynchronous web applications. With AJAX, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page.

Key Concepts:
1. Asynchronous: AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
2. XMLHTTPRequest: The core of AJAX is the XMLHTTPRequest object, which is used to send and receive data from a web server asynchronously.
3. JSON: Although XML is the traditional format for data exchange in AJAX, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is more commonly used today because it is easier to work with in JavaScript.

Basic Example:
Here is a simple example of how to use AJAX to fetch data from a server:
